                            <p>Yala is the most popular national park in Sri Lanka and for good reason! It is famous for its high leopard population, which is actually the highest leopard density in the world! Despite this, it's not guaranteed to see a leopard, as they are very elusive. However, your chances of a leopard sighting are much higher at Yala than in any of the other parks in Sri Lanka. </p>

    <h2> Best Spot to watch Leopards</h2>

    <p class="info">
        Sri Lanka is considered to be one of the best places in the world to observe leopards in their natural habitat. The island nation has a healthy population of leopards, which are a subspecies of the Indian leopard. The leopards in Sri Lanka are known for their larger size, lighter coat color, and distinct rosette patterns.

        Visitors to Sri Lanka can witness these majestic creatures in several national parks and wildlife reserves. Yala National Park, located in the southeastern region of Sri Lanka, is particularly renowned for its high density of leopards per square kilometer. Other national parks where leopards can be spotted include Wilpattu National Park and Horton Plains National park.
        
        Sri Lanka's diverse landscapes, including dense forests, grasslands, and coastal regions, provide an ideal habitat for leopards to thrive. This has led to a healthy leopard population in Sri Lanka, making it one of the best destinations in the world for observing these magnificent animals in their natural environment.

    <h2> Whale Watching in Mirissa</h2>

    <p class="info">
        Whale watching in Mirissa is an exhilarating experience that allows you to witness some of the largest creatures on earth in their natural habitat. Located in the southern coast of Sri Lanka, Mirissa is a popular destination for whale watching due to its abundance of marine life.

        During the whale watching season, which typically runs from November to April, visitors can take a boat tour out into the Indian Ocean to observe the majestic creatures. The most commonly spotted whales in Mirissa are the blue whales and sperm whales, which can grow up to 30 meters in length. These gentle giants are known to come up to the surface to breathe and can be seen spouting water from their blowholes as they exhale.
        
        Apart from whales, visitors can also spot other marine creatures such as dolphins and sea turtles during the boat tour. The tour usually takes around 3-5 hours and departs early in the morning to maximize the chances of spotting whales. It's important to choose a reputable tour operator that follows responsible whale watching practices and conservation guidelines to ensure that the experience is sustainable and ethical.
        
        Aside from whale watching, visitors can also enjoy other activities in Mirissa such as surfing, snorkeling, and relaxing on the beautiful beaches. The town is known for its laid-back vibe and friendly locals, making it a great destination for those who want to escape the hustle and bustle of city life.
